# SDP_2023
Ocean Blueâ„¢'s submission for the 2023 OSU FEH Software Design Project

## Compilation Instructions
This branch of the project is platform agnostic and can be compiled for any version of the Proteus simulator; it does not use Windows libraries or any other external tools.

Once compiled, the resulting `game.exe` executable should be kept in the same parent directory as all the asset directories (images, sounds, and stats).
